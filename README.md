# A basic A-Frame scene with Cannon.js physics

This page contains a basic scene that is created using the a-frame library https://aframe.io/ that makes use of [aframe-physics-system](https://c-frame.github.io/aframe-physics-system/) to simulate physical interaction. Boxes fall and stop, bounce, and then come to rest when hitting the floor.
